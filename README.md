This code is a password generator the can create two types of passowrds which are 
memorable and random. Memorable passwords are made using specified number of random words from a word list followed by a random digit and combined with hyphens. 
The words can be in lower case or upper and also be based on user input. 
Random passwords are generated using a mix of letters, numbers, and optional symbols and with an option to exclude certain characters.
How it works in general is the user specifies the type of password, and for each type, more options such as the number of words or length. Based on user input the code then generates the password and then is also outputted. The generated password along with a time stamp is saved to a file in a directory named after the password type (memorable or random).
